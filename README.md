Setting Difficulty Level or Stopping the Microservice:
Write a number from 0 to 8 to indicate the difficulty level of the Sudoku puzzle.
Write "stop" to terminate the microservice.

2. The Sudoku Microservice generates Sudoku puzzles and saves the output in the output.csv file. You can programmatically retrieve the processed Sudoku grid from this file.

Reading Processed Sudoku Grid:
Open and read the output.csv file to retrieve the processed Sudoku grid.
